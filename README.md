# timetrex-docker
A turnkey solution for running TimeTrex.

Well, that what this will be, eventually. My motivation is that I couldn't find affordable software for doing very basic payroll (as a household employer) until I stumbled across the open source TimeTrex project. The only issue is that setup is nontrivial. I'd like to make it easier for myself and anyone else to use the open source version of this software.
